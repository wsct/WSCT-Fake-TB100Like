# WSCT Fake JavaCard

## Objectives

Quick and dirty implementation of some Javacard classes aiming at easing the port of a javacard applet to a [WSCT](https://github.com/wsct/) environment.

## Unit testing

Beeing developed in a hurry for teaching purposes during the covid-19, please don't complain if you can't find much (if any) unit tests or if the implementation don't fully respect the javacard specification ;-) .<br/>
